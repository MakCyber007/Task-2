## 🧠 Objective

- Identify phishing indicators in a suspicious email.

- The sender domain (`@msupdate.net`) is not a legitimate Microsoft domain.
- Urgency and fear tactics are used to trick the recipient.
- Hyperlinked text leads to potentially malicious sites (not verifiable from image but assumed).
- Mimics Microsoft branding without personalization.
- Fake login alerts to induce a quick response.

## ✅ Conclusion

The email was confirmed to be a **phishing attempt** based on sender spoofing, fake urgency, branding imitation, and misleading links. The exercise emphasized how to identify such threats.
